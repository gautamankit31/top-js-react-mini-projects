# Top JS & React Mini Projects

This repository contains a collection of small projects built using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **React**, and **Tailwind CSS**. The goal of this repository is to improve and solidify my learning by creating various mini projects, experimenting with features, and enhancing development skills.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used:
- **HTML**: For the structure of the projects.
- **CSS**: Basic styling of projects.
- **JavaScript**: Logic and dynamic functionality.
- **React**: For building interactive user interfaces and managing component-based architecture.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For efficient and flexible styling.

## üöÄ Purpose:
This repository serves as a learning playground to:
- Practice and strengthen core **JavaScript** skills.
- Develop a deeper understanding of **React** and component-based development.
- Explore the utility-first CSS framework, **Tailwind CSS**.
- Build small yet impactful projects that reinforce key web development concepts.


## üß© Projects Overview:

1. **Project 1: Whack-a-Mole Game**
   - **Tech Stack**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
   - Description: A fun game where the user must click the mole as it randomly pops out from different holes.
   - Link: https://whack-the-mole.surge.sh/
   
2. **Project 2: GitHub Profile Explorer**
   - **Tech Stack**: React, Tailwind CSS, GitHub API
   - Description: A React app that allows users to search for GitHub profiles and view their repositories, followers, and other key information using the GitHub API.
   - Link: https://github-profile-dhundho.surge.sh/

More projects will be added as I continue to explore different aspects of web development.

## üì¶ How to Use:
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/top-js-react-mini-projects.git
    ```
   
2. Navigate to the project folder you want to explore:
    ```bash
    cd project1
    ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser for non-React projects. For React projects, install the necessary dependencies and run the project:
    ```bash
    cd project3
    npm install
    npm start
    ```

## üéØ Goals:
- Learn and implement modern **JavaScript** concepts.
- Build hands-on projects using **React**.
- Get comfortable with **Tailwind CSS** for fast and efficient styling.
- Gain experience in debugging, refactoring, and improving code quality.

## üí° Future Plans:
- Add more challenging projects.
- Explore advanced **React Hooks** and **Context API**.
- Implement API integration and asynchronous data handling.
- Focus on improving performance and accessibility.
